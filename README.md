A high-performance, zero-CGO Go implementation and reverse proxy gateway for **Antigravity CLI (`agy`)** on Linux, Termux, and macOS.

---

## Key Capabilities

- **Zero-CGO Pure Go (`CGO_ENABLED=0`)**: Built on pure Go standard library and modern transpiled SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`). Fully static binaries cross-compile out-of-the-box for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, and `darwin/arm64`.
- **High-Performance HTTP Reverse Proxy**: Non-blocking concurrent reverse proxy gateway listening locally (`127.0.0.1:8899`) with real-time SSE token streaming, request header filtering, and dynamic multi-account rotation.
- **Strict No-Replay Transport Guarantees**: Enforces fail-safe upstream routing. Non-idempotent or in-flight POST streaming requests are never replayed across accounts upon ambiguous network failures, preventing duplicate generation charges.
- **Intelligent Load Balancing & Failover**: Dynamically routes CLI generation requests based on configurable strategies (`max_quota`, `least_used`, `round_robin`). Automatically fails over on HTTP 429 rate limits or quota depletion while respecting upstream `Retry-After`.
- **Distinct CLI Domain Responsibilities**:
  - `agy-pool status`: Fast, script-friendly runtime summary (PID, memory, uptime, state.db schema, pool counts) without slow network quota refreshes.
  - `agy-pool list`: Compact account inventory and cached quota overview.
  - `agy-pool quota`: Dedicated quota dashboard with live progress bars and reset countdowns.
  - `agy-pool doctor`: Comprehensive system diagnostic checking binary discovery, daemon health, process table, database integrity, and Google TLS connectivity.
- **Go-Native Persistent State**: Stores authoritative pool and runtime state in SQLite (`state.db`) under `~/.local/share/agy-pool/state.db` with transactional locking and schema versioning. Legacy JSON state (`~/.gemini/agy-pool-accounts.json`) is supported strictly as legacy migration input or rollback reference data.
- **Cross-Platform Session Continuity**: Resolves and continues directory sessions across account rotations using `conversation_summaries.db`.
- **Encrypted Backup & Migration**: Securely export and import account pools with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 and CTR keystream encryption.

## Building & Installation

### Requirements
- Go 1.27 (CI and release builds use the version declared in `go.mod`)
- Standard POSIX environment (Linux, Termux, macOS)

### Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vlxlv/agy-go.git
cd agy-go

# Build native binary
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/agy-pool ./cmd/agy-pool

# Independent conversation inventory and dry-run planning tool (CP2)
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/agy-db ./cmd/agy-db
```

`agy-db` requires an explicit source directory and never modifies conversation
contents. v1 does not delete source databases; CP3 is blocked by missing
complete-ingest and activity evidence. See [inventory usage and safety boundaries](docs/AGY_DB.md).

### Cross-Compilation Matrix
Zero external C toolchains are required:
```bash
# Linux AMD64
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o dist/agy-pool-linux-amd64 ./cmd/agy-pool

# Linux ARM64
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o dist/agy-pool-linux-arm64 ./cmd/agy-pool

# macOS AMD64
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o dist/agy-pool-darwin-amd64 ./cmd/agy-pool

# macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o dist/agy-pool-darwin-arm64 ./cmd/agy-pool
```

### Installation & Native `agy` Integration

To install `agy-pool` and set up transparent integration with native Antigravity CLI:

```bash
# User-mode installation (recommended)
./bin/agy-pool install

# Or system-mode installation
sudo ./bin/agy-pool install --system
```

#### Intended User Experience

Once installed, **normal operation requires zero special flags, aliases, or manual environment exports**:

```bash
# Normal use: automatically routes through agy-pool quota load balancing
agy -p "explain this code"
agy -c
agy --mode accept-edits --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

To bypass the pool and execute native Antigravity directly against upstream Google:

```bash
# Explicit bypass: runs native Antigravity directly with its current native credentials
# No CLI Base synchronization or agy-pool routing is performed.
agy-raw -p "direct prompt"

# Or using the agy-orig alias
agy-orig -p "direct prompt"
```

#### Managed Installation Layout

The installer establishes a deterministic, robust layout:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.local/bin/agy-pool` | Go `agy-pool` binary |
| `~/.local/bin/agy` | Thin POSIX managed shim (default entrypoint invoking `agy-pool run`) |
| `~/.local/bin/agy-raw` | Managed shim executing direct native bypass via `agy-pool raw` |
| `~/.local/bin/agy-orig` | Symlink alias to `agy-raw` |
| `~/.local/libexec/agy-pool/agy-native` | Preserved real native Antigravity executable |
| `~/.config/agy-pool/config.json` | Static configuration (see tracked [`config.example.json`](config.example.json)) |
| `~/.local/share/agy-pool/state.db` | Authoritative dynamic account pool state database |

The installer safely validates and preserves the native `agy` binary into `~/.local/libexec/agy-pool/agy-native` before publishing or updating the entrypoint shim. It never overwrites the only copy of native `agy`.

#### Official `agy` Upgrades & Repair Workflow

If an official Google Antigravity update overwrites `~/.local/bin/agy` with a new native ELF binary:

1. Running `agy-pool doctor` will detect that `~/.local/bin/agy` is a native binary bypassing the pool.
2. Re-running `agy-pool install` repairs the integration:
   - Detects the new native binary at `~/.local/bin/agy`.
   - Atomically updates `~/.local/libexec/agy-pool/agy-native` with the upgraded binary.
   - Restores the managed shim at `~/.local/bin/agy`.

#### Uninstallation

To remove `agy-pool` integration:

```bash
agy-pool uninstall
```

Uninstall safely removes `agy-pool`-owned shims (`agy`, `agy-raw`, `agy-orig`), the `agy-pool` binary, and the managed native copy in `libexec/agy-pool`, while leaving any external native binaries completely untouched.

## Testing & Verification

All standard Go unit and race detector tests run completely offline without external network or token requirements:

```bash
# Run unit tests
go test ./... -count=1

# Run race detector
go test -race ./... -count=1

# Format and vet
test -z "$(gofmt -l .)"
go vet ./...

# Verify test independence without Python reference
PYTHON_REFERENCE=/nonexistent go test ./... -count=1
```

### Optional Differential Parity Verification

The external Python reference implementation is preserved strictly as an optional baseline for:
- Differential and behavioral parity testing
- Legacy state migration validation
- Emergency rollback reference

Python is **not** required for:
- Go runtime execution
- Go builds or cross-compilation
- Normal unit tests or race detector tests
- GitHub Actions CI workflows

To optionally run full differential comparison against the reference Python implementation:
```bash
PYTHON_REFERENCE=/path/to/agy-pool ./scripts/dual-test.sh
```

---

## Release & CI Architecture

- **Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)**: Triggered on push and PR to `main` with minimal permissions (`contents: read`). Runs formatting checks (`gofmt`), static analysis (`go vet`), offline unit tests, and race detector tests across standard platforms.
- **Tag-Driven Releases (`release.yml`)**: Triggered on tag pushes (`v*`) or manual `workflow_dispatch`. Re-verifies all test gates, cross-compiles static binaries for all 4 supported architectures with build-time version injection via `-ldflags`, generates and verifies unified `SHA256SUMS`, and publishes the GitHub Release (`contents: write`).
- **Production Deployment**: Production deployment remains an independent, manual operational procedure completely decoupled from CI and release publishing.

---

## Runtime guarantees

- Login accepts ID tokens only from Google's authenticated HTTPS token endpoint and validates issuer, audience, expiry, subject, and verified email before updating accounts. TLS authenticates this direct token response as permitted by [OIDC Core 3.1.3.7](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDTokenValidation); local imported JWT claims remain unverified metadata, not proof of identity.
- Interactive input is canceled and joined when `top` or login exits. The caller's stdin file remains open. Embedded callers must supply a file or in-memory reader, and custom login prompts must honor their context.
- SQLite and the native token file are separate stores. Account changes use a shared lock and attempt rollback on reported errors, but do not provide crash atomicity across both stores. Managed `agy-pool run` synchronizes from SQLite before execution; `raw` intentionally bypasses synchronization.
- `agy-pool run` may auto-start a stopped daemon, but it does not implicitly restart an already-running outdated daemon. Restart an outdated daemon explicitly with `agy-pool restart` from an independent terminal, then retry. Foreign or mismatched daemons are never restarted automatically.
- Daemon `StatusOutdatedBinary` compares the agy-pool CLI and daemon binaries; it does not describe the native AGY version. Native AGY upgrades are preserved through the managed shim repair flow and do not require a daemon restart because the proxy daemon does not load the native AGY executable.
- Streaming preserves upstream bytes and detects transport truncation. A clean HTTP EOF alone does not prove a model finished generating; protocol-specific business completion is not inferred, and a committed stream is never replayed.
